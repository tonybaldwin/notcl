Windows Installation Instructions:
---------------------------------

Your best bet, honestly, is to install NoTcl with Chocolatey (see http://www.chocolatey.org).
Chocolatey is like apt-get for Windows. If you don't know what apt-get is, that's okay.
It's just a simple, easy, safe, and secure way to download and install free/open source
software.

But you could just stick the notcl.exe anywhere you like and click on it to start it,
or make a shortcut to it on your desktop.
It's that simple. No dependencies, no complicated process, no configs.
NoTcl is a simple editor.

Now, you can, of course, see the source code in the main.tcl file,
but if you want to run that, you should have Tcl/Tk 8.5 or newer installed.
