-----------
Notcl 1.2.3
-----------

minor bug fix (ctrl-n fixed, etc.)

----------
Notcl 1.2.1
-----------

Minor changes to the GUI.
Moved the terminal button, the font-sizer, rearranged some menu items.

---------
NoTcl 1.2
---------

Added a button that will open a terminal
	either a cmd.exe in Windows, or
	xterm in gnu/linux systems

Copy/pastad the search/replace stuff from my TclText into NoTcl, too,
since it was missing that very basic, but very useful feature.

---------
NoTcl 1.1
----------

I didn't have printing working on Windows.
Now, NoTcl prints properly on either Windows or Linux.

---------
NoTcl 1.0
---------

I've had this thing lying around my linux boxen for several years for quick-n-dirty editing, taking notes, etc.
I have it bound to a keycombo in my openbox rc.xml, so I can just punch Mod1+n and take notes with it.
Handy.
But I'd never released it. There are a million text editors for linux (I have another out there, myself, 
TclText ( http://tonyb.us/tcltext ),but that one has a lot more features, 
some of which I have not yet learned to enable on Windows).
I've recently had to tolerate working on Windows, and used NoTcl there, too, mostly to take notes
while going to online class via coursera, but also for editing scripts, and whatever.
I don't know how many editors are available for Windows, but most of them I've seen, including M$'
own Notepad, are bloated monstrosities.
(NoTcl is not, nor ever will be jEdit, or EMACS (thank the GODS!), it's just a humble, basic edior.)

So, when I found Chocolatey (http://www.chocolatey.org), I though,"Hey, let's share NoTcl with other users."
Maybe someone else will find it useful. I whipped up a starkit .exe file, slapped up a github repo, and
*BOOM* first release.
